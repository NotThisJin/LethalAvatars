This is a mod for Lethal Company.
This is sorta like a SDK mod that allows you to make Avatars and replace the base Work Outfit with whatever you want.
If you have ever played VRChat and made avatars in it then this is basically how you would use this mod.
Once this mod is done i'll make a tutorial.

Also a lot of this mod is based off MoreCompany Cosmetics, but its a seperate that only utilizes Avatars rather than separate cosmetics.
